            Hallo people of the alien world of Earth! I am here today to greet you
            from our cultural and wondrous society of the "ssffgtth" people. We send
            you an invitation to join us for a nice cupper while we discuss important
            matters, like you alien people sending foul creatures that have 4 legs
            to us. Everyone knows that only 3 legged people are respected and should and
            will hold power.

            <br>

            I will not discslose any other information in case this falls in the wrong hands.
            Meet me at the cSawr where people play and occassionally touch grass.
            
            <br>

            Sincerely, 

            <br>

            Lord Ythhers
