        <h2><b><u>Taj Mahal</u></b></h2>
        <p>Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another
             10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time 
             to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be approximately ₹70 billion (about US $1 billion). The construction project 
             employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, the emperor’s court
              architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.</p>
