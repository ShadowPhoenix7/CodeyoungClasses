<!--   Functions:-
JavaScript functions are used to perform operations. We can call 
JavaScript function many times to reuse the code.
There are mainly two advantages of JavaScript functions:
1. Code reusability: We can call a function several times so it save 
coding.
2. Less coding: It makes our program compact. We donâ€™t need to 
write many lines of code each time to perform a common task.
The syntax of declaring function is given below:
function functionName()
{
//code to be executed
}
JavaScript Functions can have 0 or more arguments.
To call the function somewhere else in the script, we just have to write 
its name.-->
