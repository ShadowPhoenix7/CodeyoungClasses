            CSS Float

            <br>

            The CSS float property is a positioning property. 
            
            <br>
            
            It is used to push an
            element to the left or right, allowing other element to wrap around it. 
            
            <br>
            
            It is generally used with images and layouts.

            <br>

            To understand its purpose and origin, let's take a look to its print display. 
            
            <br>

            <p>
            In the print display, image is set into the page such that text wraps around it
            as needed.
            
            <br>

            Its web layout is also just similar to print layout.

            <br>

            Elements are floated only horizontally. So it is possible only to float
            elements left or right, not up or down.

            <br>

            Types:
            1. none - It specifies that the element is not floated, and will be
            displayed just where it occurs in the text. this is a default value.
            2. Left - It is used to float the element to the left.
            3. Right - It is used to float the element to the right.
            4. Initial - It sets the property to its initial value.
            5. Inherit - It is used to inherit this property from its parent element
