        <!-- <p>Hallo people of the alien world of Earth! I am here today to greet you
            from our cultural and wondrous society of the "ssffgtth" people. We send
            you an invitation to join us for a nice cupper while we discuss important
            matters, like you alien people sending foul creatures that have 4 legs
            to us. Everyone knows that only 3 legged people are respected and should and
            will hold power.

            <br>

            I will not discslose any other information in case this falls in the wrong hands.
            Meet me at the sharp of a bull where people play and occassionally touch grass.
            
            <br>

            Sincerely, 

            <br>

            Lord Ythhers
        </p> -->

            ● Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually 
            cause the program not to run, like the Rust error shown above. These 
            are usually easy to fix as long as you are familiar with the language's 
            syntax and know what the error messages mean.
            
            ● Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct, 
            but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that the 
            program runs incorrectly. These are often harder to fix than syntax 
            errors, as there isn't an error message to direct you to the source of 
            the error.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now how to solve these issues we should debug our code:
            1. Check all your syntax.
            2. Check whether all the tags are opened or closed properly or not, when
            we use VSC or Sublime Text its color combination scheme helps us to
            find errors
            3. Check the CSS is applied to correct tag
            4. Check that the CSS is not taken over by any other CSS properties
            5. If no CSS is coming check whether file is linked or not.
            6. Use Inspect Mode of browser to check all the code using Ctrl+Shift+I 
            or right mouse click then select inspect
            7. Check sources section to look which files are linked with that HTML 
            file.
            8. Tell the student that for debugging we use the console window in 
            inspect mode.
