            Web Hosting:
                Web hosting is effectively the process of using a server to host a website, 
                here means the final project you all are creating can be hosted or uploaded 
                to server (internet) so that anyone can use your websites.
                <br>
                <br>
                Let’s learn a few important terminologies related to hosting:
                <br>
                World Wide Web
                <br>
                ● The Web is a network of computers all over the world
                <br>
                ● All the computers in the Web can communicate with each other
                <br>
                ● All the computers use a communication protocol called HTTP
                <br>
                <br>
                How does the WWW work?
                <br>
                ● Web information is stored in documents called web pages
                <br>
                ● Web pages are files stored on computers called web servers
                <br>
                ● Computers reading the web pages are called web clients
                <br>
                ● Web clients view the pages with a program called a web browser
                <br>
                ● Popular browsers are Google Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer
                <br>
                <br>
                How does a Browser Fetch a Web Page?
                <br>
                ● A browser fetches a page from a web server by a request
                <br>
                ● A request is a standard HTTP(s) request containing a page address
                <br>
                ● An address may look like this: http://www.codeyoung.com
                <br>
                <br>
                What is a Web Server?
                <br>
                ● The collection of all your web pages is called your web site
                <br>
                ● To let others view your web pages, you must publish your web site
                <br>
                ● To publish your work, you must copy your site to a web server
                <br>
                ● Your own PC can act as a web server if it is connected to a network
                <br>
                ● Most common is to use an Internet Service Provider (ISP)
